## Introduction
This is an introduction
It is possible to convert any list to a table using the list table option.

## How to add tables

* Add tables as list tables 
* Convert a list to a table
* Use a markdown table as a list table

:::{list-table} Test
:name: Test_table
* - test
  - test2
* - test3
  - test4
:::

## Cross-reference a table

If you want to cross-reference a table, use `[](#table_name)`. Doing this will produce a highlighted table number that will be automatically updated. Example: As seen in [](#Test_table), this is a thing blah blah.

We can also write a markdown table and then use it as a list table. 

:::{list-table} Markdown table as list table
:name: Test_mdtable
* - | test | test2 |
    |------|-------|
    | test3 | test4 |
:::

In this case [](#Test_mdtable) is a list table

## Figures and images can be added

:::{figure} https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cat-10-e1573844975155-scaled.jpg
:name: cat_web
This image of cat is taken off the web
:::

I can refer to the image as [](#cat_web)

I could also save this image of the cat to the local folder where I have the paper and then replace the rest of the url with `./`, it would have the same effect.
