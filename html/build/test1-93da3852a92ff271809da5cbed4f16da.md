Abstract

Write an abstract as the first human readable element of the paper. 
Separate the title of the abstract from the rest of the body or a heading from the rest of the body using a blank line.
One line per line is fine.
The abstract is unformatted.
In this paper we are describing how to write a paper using myst markdown.

## Introduction
Myst markdown or Curvenote markdown enables you to use markdown and jupyter notebooks together to weave codes, figures, and data to tell a data-driven narrative, but you can also use it as plain markdown to write a story in different formats. 

## How to get started with myst-markdown

You can install myst markdown for your operating system with the following code (assuming you have first installed `node` and `npm`)

```
npm install -g myst-cli

```
You can also alternatively use `npm install -g curvenote` and in that case you will use `curvenote` instead of `myst`.

Then, in a folder create the following two files:

- A markdown file and give it a name like `foo.md`
- A jupyter notebook file and give it a name like `foo.ipynb`
- Optionally, if you use `bibtex` for your reference management, then add a bibtex file in the same folder with something like `foo.bib`.
- You can keep your figures in the same folder or in a subfolder in the same folder if you like
- After this, test that everything works with `myst init` at the command prompt
- When `myst init` finishes, it will ask you if you want to start a server, respond `yes` or `Y`. It will start a server at `localhost:3000`. If you cannot open `localhost:3000` on your browser, open something like `https://127.0.0.1:3000` or something similar. You will see a webpage that is pretty much empty or blank, and that is fine. You are now ready to work on the pages. 

Then write your content in the markdown file using markdown. You can use academic markdown or jupyter flavoured markdown if you like. At the beginning of the markdown file, start with a `frontmatter` block with something like follows:

```
---
title: Title of your paper
authors:
  - name: Your name
  - email: your email
  - affiliation: your affiliation, etc
bibliography: foo.bib
---

```

I recommend that this is a bare minimum to get started with a myst-markdown file. Consult the myst webpage to learn more about formatting your paper. This will let you create a webpage. If you want to export your file to word, then add an `export: docx` line to the frontmatter. 

You generally use a jupyter notebook for generating figures and tables, and use the markdown to write the narrative. Conventionally, we know writing any academic or scholarly document requires the writer to provide the following structure (this can vary but generally this is true of most structures):

* An Abstract
* An Introduction or the background
* A section on methods etc
* A set of results if that is applicable
* A discussion section
* Tables
* Figures
* Citations throughout the paper
* A list of references at the end of the paper appended to it

## How to convert a list to a table

The above list in myst markdown can be conveniently converted to a table
Let's copy paste and add what we want by way of describing each one.

:::{list-table} Table explaining the elements of a paper
:name: tbl_elements
* - Item
  - Description
* - Abstract
  - A short statement summarising the paper
* - Introuction
  - An Introduction or the background
* - Methods
  - A section on methods etc
* - Results
  - A set of results if that is applicable
* - Discussion
  - A discussion section
* - Tables
  - Tabular format to present complex ideas
* - Figures
  - Plots, or image formats
* - Citations 
  - Should be throughout the paper. Also as a list of references at the end of the paper appended to it
:::

This list table now becomes table one if you want to refer to it as [](#tbl_elements) where the name of the table is what you write within a pair of parentheses after a pair of square brackets. 

## Summary: how to add tables
So, the above process is one way to add a table. Another way to add a table is to use a list table or use a markdown table.

* Add tables as list tables 
* Convert a list to a table
* Use a markdown table as a list table

:::{list-table} A simple list table
:name: Test_table
* - test
  - test2
* - test3
  - test4
:::

## Cross-reference a table

If you want to cross-reference a table, use `[](#table_name)`. Doing this will produce a highlighted table number that will be automatically updated. Example: As seen in [](#Test_table), this is a thing blah blah.

We can also write a markdown table and then use it as a list table. 

:::{list-table} Markdown table as list table
:name: Test_mdtable
* - | test | test2 |
    |------|-------|
    | test3 | test4 |
:::

In this case [](#Test_mdtable) is a list table

## How to add figures and images

:::{figure} https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cat-10-e1573844975155-scaled.jpg
:name: cat_web
This image of cat is taken off the web
:::

I can refer to the image as [](#cat_web)

I could also save this image of the cat to the local folder where I have the paper and then replace the rest of the url with `./`, it would have the same effect. Later on in this document I will write how you can intereface a jupyter notebook with all these elements with cross-referencing, but for now pretend we are writing using nothing but markdown syntax.


## How to add Citations and table of references

Citations are important and there are a few ways to insert citations in myst markdown formatted papers. The easiest way is to locate the DOI of the paper say from [crossref.org](https://www.crossref.org) and insert the DOI.  Like this `[](doi url)` will produce something like as follows: a statement by
[](https://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw1c) if it is a valid DOI, it will parse the DOI, add a citation and add a reference item when it produces the formatted page. 

A second method of producing the same content using the DOI and nothing else is to use {cite}`doi:10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw1c` ; this will also produce something similar. In this case start with cite code and then add the `doi: doi` next to it. 

A third method, if you do not have a valid DOI, is to use a bibtex file and then do as follows:

1. First add the bibtex file to the frontmatter
2. Then add the reference to the bibtex file
3. Then source the bibtext file id in the text of the paper

The following citation was posted this way. White has written an article on how to write scholarly documents ({cite}`white2022` ). There are other ways of writing this as well, such as {cite:t}`white2022` has proposed ways of writing scholarly document and so on. The idea here is you put together a bibtex file, add it to the folder where you keep your markdown file and then when you want to cite it, use this syntax of `{cite}` followed by `doi` written between backticks. The doi could be raw doi taken off from crossref or from anywhere or you can use the citation id of the citation that you want to add to your paper. 

## Interface with Jupyter Notebook

Working with Jupyter notebooks in the same folder, it is possible to add any table, figure or code from a cell in the notebook to the markdown document and output it. This keeps the analyses clean and focused and the content authoring under control. This is really helpful if you have to work with multiple authors who need to read the outputs and tables and figures and where necessary, if anyone want to review the codes, they can be shared as well with the raw `ipynb` file. Here are the steps:

1. Start every code block with `#| label: xxx` where xxx is whatever label you want to assign to that code block
2. Generate a table or a figure as an output
3. Work with `Julia`, using prettytable package, output the table as a markdown table
4. If you work with R or Python, use knitr or another package to output the table as markdown table
5. In the main body, you can either directly cross-refence that table with `![](#label of the code block)` or copy paste from the notebook. Note here the use of the bang sign.
6. You do something similar with figures. You can either directly show cross-reference with `![](#label)` or save the figure as a png or jpg and show them directly as you do with figures.


## How to output results of a table from ipynb

![](#test_table_jup)

If you take a look at this above table, it is a raw table from jupyter, not as fun. This can be made useful depending on your use case but there are some other ways. You can embed this notebook output as a list table 

:::{list-table} Test table from jupyter
:name: test_table_jup_formatted
* - ![](#test_table_jup)
:::

Still not good and and basically same as above, Worst, it seems embedded.

How about copying and pasting and then modifying the table?

:::{list-table} Test table from jupyter
:name: test_table_jup_copied
* - |     x |     y |
    |-------|-------|
    |     1 |     6 |
    |     2 |     7 |
    |     3 |     8 |
    |     4 |     9 |
    |     5 |    10 |
:::

A little bit of work in the sense you will need to line up the rows but the results are much prettier if you output as markdown table.

Something similar happens if you want to output a figure. In this case, do something like as follows:

:::{figure} ./fig1.png
:name: test_fig_jup
A test figure
:::

Should output a figure resulting from a jupyter code with a title and a label. It will also have an alt text. Alternatively,

![Test figure](#test_fig_jup)

can be used to directly output a figure directly from the Jupyter Notebook.
